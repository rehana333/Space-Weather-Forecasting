# Solar Flare Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project involves the development and evaluation of deep learning models to predict solar flare events based on time series data. The project focuses on utilizing LSTM and GRU architectures for effective sequence modeling.

## Project Overview

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation from the sun, impacting space weather. This project uses historical solar flare data to build predictive models, aiming to support early warning systems for space weather forecasting.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares time series data , handling missing values and normalization.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for prediction.
- **Evaluation and Analysis**: Models are trained and evaluated on their ability to forecast solar flare events, with year-based analysis to understand prediction accuracy across different timeframes.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: For model building and data processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for LSTM and GRU models.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing predictions and model performance.

### Results and Findings

The models showed promising predictive capabilities, although further research is needed to achieve high accuracy across all solar activity levels.
